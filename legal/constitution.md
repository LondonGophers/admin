## ✍️ Go London User Group Constitution

The following document specifies the rules and regulations for the Go London User Group (GLUG).

### Overview
Go London User Group (“London Gophers”) is a meetup group dedicated to the Go programming language, designed to bring like-minded individuals together to network, share experiences and hear talks from other like-minded individuals. 

The meetups are open to all members. We typically hold one event per month in central London. As of Dec 2018, we have ~2600 members, and our monthly meetups of around 150-200 people are massively over-subscribed.

### Membership
Membership of GLUG is free and open to all. There are no joining or subscription fees. 

Membership is managed through our meetup.com group (https://www.meetup.com/Go-London-User-Group/) where individuals are free to join or leave as they wish. All members of the GLUG Meetup group are referred to as Ordinary Members. There are no other membership levels.

All attendees, organisers and sponsors are required to follow the Go Community Code of Conduct (https://golang.org/conduct). Failure to do so may result in suspension or termination of membership.

### Committee / Organisers
The Committee of GLUG are also known as the Organisers, and these persons are drawn from the Ordinary Members. 

The minimum number of Organisers required is 1; there is no maximum. 

A subset of the Committee form the Executive Committee, which comprises at most 3 people. The Executive Committee roles that must be filled are: Chairperson and Treasurer; Secretary is currently optional.

Ordinary Members may put themselves forward to become an Organiser. They must have attended at least one event within the last 12 months. They must be seconded by one other Ordinary Member (non-Organiser), as well as an existing Organiser. They will become an Organiser following agreement by all other Organisers.

There is no set election schedule for GLUG, so this can be completed at any time. An Organiser may choose to step down at any point and does so by informing all other organisers.

#### Organisers must step down if:
* They are inactive in the group for 6 months. This includes attending meetups and Organiser meetings.
* All other Organisers unanimously decide it is in the best interests of The GLUG that this person step down

#### Lead Organiser
There is one Lead Organiser. This person fulfils the role of both Chairperson & Treasurer. In the case of the Lead Organiser stepping down, the remaining Organisers must find/agree on another Lead Organiser to fill the role.

### Organiser Meetings
There must be a minimum of one Organisers’ meetings (separate to any other organised events) per calendar year.

Any Organiser may call a meeting and it is considered quorate if at least 50% of Organisers are present, including the Lead Organiser. 

Any Ordinary Member may attend an Organisers’ meeting, but may only be given speaking rights on agreement of the majority of attending Organisers.

### Finance & Property

#### Bank Accounts & Finance
The Lead Organiser will be a signatory on any and all bank accounts. Any other Organiser may become a signatory and have a debit card on agreement of all other organisers. Any action related to the bank account should be able to be actioned with just one signature. 
Any financial transactions must take place through the Organisation bank account.
The Organisation must not borrow money and must act within its own means. 
Any individual transaction over the value of £200 must have the agreement of at least one other Organiser. 
Any purchases for GLUG made by an Organiser who is not a card holder may be claimed back from the Lead Organiser on presentation of a receipt.

#### Other Assets
For the operation of GLUG, it will hold a number of other assets. Some of these may just be held temporarily (such as prizes or giveaways), some may be more permanent (video equipment). 
Any assets are property of GLUG and not that of Organisers. 
Assets should be used for GLUG purposes only, unless agreement is made with the Organisers. 
Ordinary Members may request access to assets from Organisers. 
Where assets are stored at an Organiser’s house, if they step down, they must pass all assets to another Organiser.

### Closing Go London User Group
The Organisation must be closed if:
* There are no events or meetings organised for a period of 12 months.
* It is unable to form an organisation committee.
* It is unable to find a Lead Organiser.

If the Organisers wish to close the meetup group for any other reason, then all members must be informed of the reason. Should another group of organisers be able to be formed within two weeks, then the group shall continue to operate under the new organisation group.

#### On the closing of the group:
All assets must be offered to any other UK based Go meetup group, or London based meetup group. No money can be exchanged for these.
On being unable to find an organisation to take the assets, where suitable they should be donated to charity, otherwise destroyed.
Digital assets should be passed to another Go meetup group. Where funds allow, items such as domains and hosting should have enough credit added to their accounts to last 5 years. 
Access should be linked to a generic email address and the login details for this should be handed over.
Any remaining funds should be donated to Women Who Go (https://www.womenwhogo.org).

### Rules Changes
These rules may be changed by simple majority of Organisers, at any organisers meeting attended by the Lead Organiser.
