### Sponsorship 

We have been being asked for updated information about how people can contribute to the London Gophers community and help support us as a meetup to contine to grow and support the community.

Main points:
* Sponsorship Pack
  * Finalise the PR that will be published via the GitHub repo that will explain our sponsorship
  * 3 types Recurring, Venue, Adhoc
    * prefer recurring where we will have a montly contribution 
  * Any remaining money at the end of the period will go towards scholarships for people in the community to attend go conferences
  * Finalising wording on PR together as a group
  * Will try and ensure that introductions are kept to a maximum of 2 minutes
    * Aware that a long sponsorship introductions could be uncofortable to sit through
  * Would be nice to start offering to help with travel for speakers in the UK

**Decision**: Documented decisions here [Sponsorship](../../sponsorship/README.md).

* Outreach
  * we should contact past sponsors to see if they would like to read through the updates and hopefully provide sponsorship

* Invoice
  * Ensure that we have a invoice ready for those companies that are happy to be recurring so that we can invoice
  * based of +kasiazien existing document
  * shared via Google documents

* Sponsorship advice
  * should ensure that sponsors get the most out of the events to help them with this we can outline some things that have proved succesful in the past
  * being clearly visible at the meetup (tshirts, area)
  * want to make sure people know how to approach you
  * short succinct intro slides ... think LUSH

### GitHub
* updated meetup slides to contain links to previous talks and videos
* should start periodically adding more details to automate ourselves out of work
* can this be displayed in a better way ... integrate with the gophers.london site or gitbooks?
