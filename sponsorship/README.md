## ðŸ’µ Sponsorship

As a meetup, we rely on our sponsors to help make our evenings even better. We know everyone at meetups loves some food and refreshments!

### Sponsorship Opportunities

As sponsorship goes we normally look for help in supporting the meetup and community in a few different ways:

* Hosting - We are looking for London based venues that will hold 200+ people that we can host the meetup at. This would most likely be the middle Wednesday of the month from around 6:30 till 9pm.

* Food & Refreshments - We normally spend around Â£900 on catering every month so that everyone can have some food and drinks while  socialising during the breaks. Pizza always goes down a treat but we are open to trying new food for the event. We always provide a mix of alcoholic and soft drinks and vegetarian options to suit our diverse community.

**We are looking for recurring sponsors who will contribute Â£200 every month.**

This will allow us to secure the group's ability to host everyone on a monthly basis. It will also allow us to keep improving the experience we provide by investing in recording equipment, inviting well-known speakers or sponsoring diversity tickets to conferences for our attendees with any surplus left.

We also graciously accept one-off sponsorship offers towards the cost of food & refreshments.

Both recurring and one-off sponsors will be featured prominently during the meetup. We will also advertise our recurring sponsors outside of the event nights and tweet once a month about their job openings.

### Why Sponsor?

We have a huge outreach as a community so it's a great opportunity for your company and brand to get exposure to many eager engineers. Normally we have between 150-200 people turn up on the evening (with 300+ signing up for the event). We are in the top ten biggest Go meetups in the world and hope to be growing the community even more in the coming months.

We also have a number of people that view our live stream on YouTube. All our videos feature logos of our sponsors for that month and can be viewed after the event on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZPhOgp4kDXkg2W8jL4U7GA).

### What's in it for you?

We hope that you will get exposure to many amazing and active engineers at our meetups, so we look to make sure that we give you exposure both during the event, leading up to and after the evening.

- You will be listed as our sponsor in the invite that goes out to all our members on meetup.com (currently over 2800).
- During the event, we will make sure that the opening and closing slides have all sponsor logos present (they will also be shown on the live stream).
- We offer you the option to stand up and do a 2-3 minute sponsorship introduction to let our community know more about you and what you are doing (slides are optional).
- Will make sure that we tweet mentioning you leading up to the event and after so that our followers know about your support for the community.

Please reach out to us if you have any questions or if you'd like to sponsor!
