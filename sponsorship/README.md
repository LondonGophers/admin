## ðŸ’µ Sponsorship

London Gophers is a volunteer-run organisation that seeks to remain as friendly and welcoming as possible to everyone. Therefore membership of London Gophers is 100% free and we do not charge for attending events. Not only that, but we provide food and drink at all of our events! We therefore rely on sponsorship to cover our costs.

### Where do we incur costs?
* Venues - we need London based venues that can hold 200+ people. Our meetups are typically around the middle of the month on a Wednesday and run from 18:30-21:00.

* Food - we normally spend between Â£400 - Â£600 on food every month so that everyone can enjoy the evening on a full, rather than empty, stomach! We try to cater for all different diets/allergies. Various flavours/forms of pizza always go down a treat but we are always open to trying different ideas!

* Drinks - as with food we spend Â£400 - Â£600 to provide drinks and refreshments for everyone on the evening. We try to offer a wide range of drinks to cover all preferences!

* AV/equipment - every London Gophers meetup is streamed live on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/LondonGophers). Until now, the organisers have used their own personal equipment, but clearly this is not sustainable/appropriate.

* Speaker costs - sometimes we have visiting speakers and where possible we look to help them with reasonable costs, like train tickets. Clearly where possible we look to minimise costs in this area by inviting speakers at a time that coincides with a pre-existing trip to London, but this is not always possible.

* Admin - we use [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) to schedule our events which costs us about Â£80 a year in subscription fees. Otherwise we use free tools and services whenever possible to help with the day to day organisation of the meetup.

Because we are a non-profit organisation, we will typically put any surplus funds towards conference scholarship funds such as https://www.gophercon.co.uk/scholarships/.

As mentioned above, the organising committee of London Gophers are volunteers. We are always on the lookout for people keen to join our team!

### Sponsorship Options
We have three categories of sponsorship:

* Recurring sponsors. Contribute Â£200 every month and get listed on our website, listed in our main slide deck for each meetup and get thanked and mentioned throughout the meetup. **We are actively looking for recurring sponsors.**
* Venue sponsors. Venue sponsors will each host us a few times a year. You will be listed in the main slide deck and thanked/mentioned at each meetup you host. We are not looking for venue sponsors at this time.
* Ad-hoc sponsorship. Be it covering food, drinks or venue for the odd meetup, or a donation to cover a specific cost.

All sponsors will be featured prominently during the meetup they sponsor. We will also advertise our recurring sponsors outside of the event nights and tweet once a month about their job openings.

### Why Sponsor?

We have a huge outreach as a community so it's a great opportunity for your company and brand to get exposure to many eager engineers.
- We have over 3000 members on [our meetup.com group](https://www.meetup.com/Go-London-User-Group/).
- 150-250 people turn up to each meetup every month (with 300+ signing up for the event).
- We are in the top ten biggest Go meetups in the world and hope to be growing the community even more in the coming months.

We also have a number of people that view our live stream on YouTube. All our videos feature logos of our sponsors for that month and can be viewed after the event on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/LondonGophers).

### What's in it for you?

We hope that you will get exposure to many amazing and active engineers at our meetups, so we look to make sure that we give you exposure both during the event, leading up to and after the evening.

- You will be listed as our sponsor in the invite that goes out to all our members on meetup.com (currently over 3000).
- During the event, we will make sure that the opening and closing slides have all sponsor logos present (they will also be shown on the live stream).
- We offer every new sponsor the option to stand up and do a 2 minute sponsorship introduction to let our community know more about you and what you are doing at one of the meetups.
- Will make sure that we tweet mentioning you leading up to the event and after so that our followers know about your support for the community.

Please reach out to us if you have any questions or if you'd like to sponsor!
