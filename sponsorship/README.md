## ðŸ’µ Sponsorship

As a meetup, we rely on our sponsors to help make our evenings even better. We know everyone at meetups loves some food and refreshments!

### Sponsorship Opportunities

As sponsorship goes we normally look for help in supporting the meetup and community in a few different ways:

* Hosting - We are looking for London based venues that will hold 200+ people that we can host the meetup at. This would most likely be the middle Wednesday of the month from around 6:30 till 9pm.

* Food - We normally spend between Â£300 - Â£400 on catering every month so that everyone can have some food and an opportunity to  socialise during the food break. Pizza always goes down a treat but we are also open to trying new food for the event.

* Refreshments - As with food we are looking to get between Â£300 - Â£400 to provide drinks and refreshments for everyone on the evening. We are keen to make sure that we have a wide range of drinks that suit our diverse community.

**We are looking for recurring sponsors who will contribute Â£200 every month or host us a few times a year.**

This will allow us to secure the group's ability to host everyone on a monthly basis. It will also allow us to keep improving the experience we provide by investing in recording equipment and inviting well-known speakers.

We also graciously accept one-off sponsorship offers, be it to cover food, refreshments or venue for one event. 

Both recurring and one-off sponsors will be featured prominently during the meetup. We will also advertise our recurring sponsors outside of the event nights and tweet once a month about their job openings.

### Why Sponsor?

We have a huge outreach as a community so it's a great opportunity for your company and brand to get exposure to many eager engineers. Normally we have between 150-200 people turn up on the evening (with 300+ signing up for the event). We are in the top ten biggest Go meetups in the world and hope to be growing the community even more in the coming months.

We also have a small number of people that view our live stream or watch the videos after the event via [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZPhOgp4kDXkg2W8jL4U7GA). All our videos feature the logos of our sponsors for that month.

### What's in it for you?

We hope that you will get exposure to many amazing and active engineers at our meetups, so we look to make sure that we give you exposure both during the event, leading up to and after the evening.

- During the event, we will make sure that the opening and closing slides have all sponsor logos present (they will also be shown on the live stream).
- We offer you the option to stand up and do a 2-3 minute sponsorship introduction to let our community know more about you and what you are doing (slides are optional).
- Will make sure that we tweet mentioning you leading up to the event and after so that our followers know about your support for the community.

Please reach out to us if you have any questions or if you'd like to sponsor!
