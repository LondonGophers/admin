## ðŸ’µ Sponsorship

London Gophers is a volunteer-run organisation that seeks to remain as friendly and welcoming as possible to everyone. Therefore membership of London Gophers is 100% free and we do not charge for attending events. Not only that, but we provide food and drink at all of our events! We therefore rely on sponsorship to cover our costs.

### Sponsorship Options
We have three categories of sponsorship:

* Recurring sponsors. Contribute a fixed amount every month. **We are actively looking for recurring sponsors.**
* Venue sponsors. Venue sponsors will each host us a few times a year. We are not looking for venue sponsors at this time.
* Ad-hoc sponsorship. Be it covering food, drinks or venue for the odd meetup, or a donation to cover a specific cost.

Please contact us with any question or to discuss further: glug-organisers@googlegroups.com

### Why Sponsor?

We have a huge outreach as a community so sponsoring London Gophers is a great opportunity for your company/brand:

* we have over 3000 members on [our meetup.com group](https://www.meetup.com/Go-London-User-Group/), and a strong following on Twitter, [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/LondonGophers) and Slack
* we welcome ~250 people to our monthly meetups (and often have a long waitlist)
* we are one of the top five Go meetups in the world, and are committed to remaining as friendly and welcoming as possible to everyone

Specifically, sponsors enjoy a number of benefits:

* listed in the invite that goes out to all our members on meetup.com
* the opening and closing slides for a meetup feature logos
* new sponsors are given the option to stand up and do a 2 minute introduction
* logos feature in our live stream to YouTube and the videos on our channel
* mentioned in our tweets leading up to the event and after so that our followers know about your support for the community

In addition, recurring sponsors will be listed prominently on our website.

### Where do we incur costs?
* Venues - we need London based venues that can hold 250+ people. Our meetups are typically around the middle of the month on a Wednesday and run from 18:30-21:00.

* Food - we normally spend up to Â£600 on food every month so that everyone can enjoy the evening on a full, rather than empty, stomach! We try to cater for all different diets/allergies. Various flavours/forms of pizza always go down a treat but we are always open to trying different ideas!

* Drinks - as with food we spend up to Â£600 to provide drinks and refreshments for everyone on the evening. We try to offer a wide range of drinks to cover all preferences!

* AV/equipment - every London Gophers meetup is streamed live on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/LondonGophers). Until now, the organisers have used their own personal equipment, but clearly this is not sustainable/appropriate.

* Speaker costs - sometimes we have visiting speakers and where possible we look to help them with reasonable costs, like train tickets. Clearly where possible we look to minimise costs in this area by inviting speakers at a time that coincides with a pre-existing trip to London, but this is not always possible.

* Admin - we use [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) to schedule our events which costs us about Â£80 a year in subscription fees. Otherwise we use free tools and services whenever possible to help with the day to day organisation of the meetup.

Because we are a non-profit organisation, we will typically put any surplus funds towards conference scholarship funds such as https://www.gophercon.co.uk/scholarships/.

As mentioned above, the organising committee of London Gophers are volunteers. We are always on the lookout for people keen to join our team!
