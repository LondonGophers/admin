# London Gophers Jobs Fair

As we grown as a community we wish to continue the support of both employers looking to hire talented Gophers and employees looking for a great place to work.

- `#london-jobs` slack channel.
- Feel free to post jobs and enquiries in here.

## FAQ
- But we used to announce at events..
  - Based on feedback from both people hiring and looking for jobs the short 30seconds presentation on the evening worked great when we were a smaller meetup but as we grow it has become too drawn out and chaotic. This also resulted in people hearing about jobs but not knowing how or where to follow up on opportunities. Changing to a special interest group on Slack allows all London based community members interact and share jobs on a regular basis regardless of attendance to meetups.

- Why not just get rid of the jobs section?
  - We feel that as a community we want to support companies large and small looking for talented engineers. Some companies might not be able to afford sponsoring meetups or attending them on a regular basis to talk to engineers but we still want everyone to be succesful in their search. Moving this to a more community focused Slack channel allows us to hopefully support the majority of peoples needs.

- Why Slack?
  - Slack is a great place to show what is happening at a specific moment in time. People looking and vacancies change over time, a Slack channel allows us to keep up to date with the changing needs of the community.

- Can I post a job there?
  - Sure, post away!

- Can I post the job multiple times?
  - Yes. However, please be respectful of the community and the needs of the people in the channel.

- Can I look for work there?
  - Sure, good luck.

- What if it sucks!?
  - If it sucks, we iterate and work with the community to make it "suck" less.
