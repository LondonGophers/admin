## Sponsorship information

Hi XXX

**[pasted from PHPSW - to be edited for GLUG!]**

In answer to your question PHP-SW runs 2 streams for sponsorship. 

We have our regular sponsors. This money covers most of the running costs of the meetup: speakers expenses, meetup costs, video editing, drinks, etc. Currently all slots for regular sponsors are full.

Our second sponsorship stream is venue sponsor. Due to increasing numbers of attendees over the past 6 months we've had to find bigger venues. The cost of hiring these venues is covered by our venue sponsor. To be a venue sponsor you either:
- arrange or supply a room in central Bristol suitable for giving talks with a capacity of >60. Venue sponsors also cover the cost of pizza for the attendees.
- pay for PHP-SW to organise a suitable room (we normally use DeskLodge). Cost is approx Â£350.

Venue sponsors is more ad-hoc, done on a month by month basis. 

Being a sponsor of PHP-SW has the following benefits:

- You will be listed as our sponsor in the invite that goes out to all our members (currently over 800).
- During the introduction slides you can have a couple of slides to introduce your company and say a few words (2/3mins).
- We'll retweet up to 3 tweets about your company around the time of the meetup you sponsor. Currently PHPSW has 1500 followers).
- Videos of the talks at the meetup will appear on youtube and will have your logo at the start.

Typically PHP-SW has anywhere between 45 and 65 attendees who turn up for an event. We are starting to get over 60 on a regular basis. Those who attend range from those just starting out in their career to people who have been around for 20+ years. It's quite a self selecting audience. Most attendees are based in Bristol, Bath the the surrounding area. The attendees are switched on, take an interest in furthering their knowledge, just the kind of people that companies would want to employ. 

Events run on the second Wednesday of every month. 11 events are talk nights. December is a Christmas social. There is informal networking before, between and after the talks. It's an excellent opportunity to get to know people. 

If you've not been to PHP-SW before I recommend popping along to see what it's all about. Our next talk night is January. You'd also be welcome to come along to the Christmas social too. 

If you've got any more questions then please get in touch.


Kind regards
