## Invoicing

#### How do I know who to invoice?
Either ask in the @glug-organisers Slack, or check the [Sponsors tab in the Sponsorship & Money tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tP_SEtLAjaDotx89wIW77OK6fNiDQr6bXsgRNGwmeRY/edit#gid=0).
We usually invoice on a monthly basis or for 6 months in advance. The Notes column in the Sponsors sheet will tell you.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a new invoice
Head over to [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1NPbAE9AtfZCKb99FET5TdjTpR66lrnGd).
Find the sponsor you're looking for, or create a new directory.

Copy one of the existing invoices and update the file name appropriately.

If it's an existing sponsor, you just need to update:
- invoice reference ‚ö†Ô∏è **in two places** ‚ö†Ô∏è (`#<company><month-abbreviation><year(2 digits)>`, e.g. `#MONZONOV19`)
- invoice date (this is today's date)
- due date (this is the last day of the current month, check if it's 28, 29, 30 or 31!)

If it's a new sponsor, make sure to adjust the sponsorship amount too. 

Save the file as .pdf.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Update the Sponsorship & Money tracker
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tP_SEtLAjaDotx89wIW77OK6fNiDQr6bXsgRNGwmeRY/edit#gid=1608906958

Add a new row for each invoice you created. Copy the details over from the invoice and mark as 'Pending'.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Send the invoice
Email is fine, something like:
```
Hi <name>,

Hope you're doing well! Just sending the <month> invoice through. As always, if there's anything you'd like us to announce or tweet about at the next meetup just let us know. 

Warmly,
<your name> & GLUG
```

Make sure to cc `glug-organisers@googlegroups.com` and don't forget to attach the invoice file! üôÇ

Email addresses to use are in the [Sponsorship & Money tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tP_SEtLAjaDotx89wIW77OK6fNiDQr6bXsgRNGwmeRY/edit#gid=0).

That's it! üéâ

### Reconciliation
(this step requires access to the GLUG bank account)

If you spot a sponsorship payment came in, make sure to mark it as 'Paid' in the [Sponsorship & Money tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tP_SEtLAjaDotx89wIW77OK6fNiDQr6bXsgRNGwmeRY/edit#gid=1608906958).
