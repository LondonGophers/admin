We use [joind.in](https://joind.in) to gather feedback about the talks and the event itself.

## Why?
Receiving constructive feedback is incredibly helpful to speakers - new and experienced alike - as it helps them improve. 
It is also useful to the organisers.

## How to give good feedback?
Be kind and constructive in your feedback. Point out what you liked and what you didn't like, and suggest some ideas / improvements.
BE KIND!
Giving a talk in front of a few hundred people is not easy, especially for new speakers. Keep that in mind when you're writing a comment. We're all here to support each other!

### good feedback examples
"Some great points to help all levels of developers, gaining some insight into things I do (or don't) which I shouldn't (or should). Even as a senior developer it highlighted some points I had not previously thought of. It felt a little rushed but appreciate the time available is small"

"Very engaging stage presence, amazing GIFs. You blocked some of the slide, which wasn't a big problem.
Great mirroring of the resource gif. Funny.
I like that you give the meetup we're in as all example of immersing yourself in the community.
I like the Y tip. I mean, all the tips are just great. Great talk, I want to see it again."

"Confident delivery and very entertaining slides to start the evening of talks. Made some good points, could maybe expand on the suggestions for getting over the X problem."

"Good intro. Keep a consistent volume, you went a bit quiet when you talked about the academy people in the room.
Relatable on-stage presence! Really good points, I saw the people around me nodding pensively.
I loved the emphasis on..."

You get the idea ;)

### bad feedback example
"great" (especially if you also gave less than 5 stars - explain why!)
